## **_Installation_**
Here are some guidelines for installing the project on your local machine in order to be able to try it:

1. Clone or download the repository to your own local machine and run it from your command line.

2. Then, make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. You can create one by running ```npm init``` in your command line, and ```npm install``` to install the dependencies.

3. Run ```npm run develop``` in your terminal from the root directory to launch the application. Or check the deployed app directly on the app's heroku link (https://young-hollows-30363.herokuapp.com/). If the heroku link is not working open the app locally by entering ```npm run develop``` and going to the following link: ```http://localhost:3000``` (might be 3001, or 3002 etc depending on your local machine and if other apps are already using localhost).

4. Enjoy and don't hesitate to contribute! ðŸ™‚
